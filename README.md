In this project, we delve into the fascinating world of restaurant sales analysis to uncover valuable insights that can drive business decisions and enhance customer experience. Leveraging data analytics techniques, we explore various aspects of sales performance, customer behavior, and product popularity within our restaurant. Our analysis includes examining key metrics such as total amount spent by each customer, total amount spent by each food category, monthly and yearly sales trends, as well as insights into product purchasing patterns. Additionally, we delve into customer engagement metrics such as frequency of visits and analyze sales performance across different countries and order sources. By understanding these metrics, we aim to optimize operations, improve customer satisfaction, and drive revenue growth.
